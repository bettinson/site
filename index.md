I'm a Canadian software developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I like to write [code](https://github.com/bettinson) and [words](https://mattbettinson.com/), make [music](https://aethrum.bandcamp.com/), and take [photos](https://www.instagram.com/bettinson/).

You can mostly find me on [Github](http://github.com/bettinson). Get in touch via [email](mailto:mattbettinson@gmail.com).
