I'm a Canadian developer working at [Rietta](https://rietta.com/) writing Ruby on Rails. My app [PicText](https://github.com/bettinson/pic-text) was on Apple's App Store. I wrote the app the Brooklyn Nets use to plan courtside plays. I like to write code and words, make music, take photos.

You can mostly find me on [Github](http://github.com/bettinson). Get in touch via [email](mailto:mattbettinson@gmail.com).

⭐️ posts are my favorites.
